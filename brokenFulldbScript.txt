The people far and wide were blessed with good fortune and bounteous harvests. The court astrologer Joseph once surveyed the harvests, and stars, and calendar, and discovered an amazing fact. After a visit by the Helen and Heather, to any farm, creamery, windmill, or fishing village, in short, a visit to anywhere associated with the growing and harvesting of nature’s bounty, that place would flourish in the coming year. In fact, Helen spent most of  her time trotting her mother’s elderly pony and buggy to and fro to visit these sites. She even helped in moving important tools, the mail, and inventions to these places, but she always left enough space for Heather to come along. Before long the fame of Helen, Heather, and Oats (the pony) spread beyond Provence and visitors came with offers to purchase Heather’s kits. Physically, Helen, despite being a princess was a strong girl, much of this had to do with her upbringing. Helen’s chores, which were not princess like in the least, included chopping firewood in Fall, milking two goats in the morning for breakfast, and using the tread pump filling the castle water tank daily (this involved pumping 300 liters up 3 meters) so that the kitchen and bathrooms had pressure. Also, Mistral was a hotbed of invention, as Joseph and Papa, the lord of Mistral, were always looking for ways to improve life, sometimes Helen would be directed to help on the newest idea.

However, Gallagher’s cart was present, but there was no sign of him. A chill went through Helen’s heart that Heather may have been stolen. 

Papa quickly said “go to your studies” we have enough hands and effort on this task. Helen felt a surge of anger at being sent to do something as unimportant as studies, especially given all the math that Stephen constantly spouted, and tested.

The actual merchant just arrived, that Rogue shot him and stole the cart then sold all the supplies to us”. Papa is planning on letting the merchant recover here at the Castle but is sending me in the buggy with another horse after Gallagher. The Merchant’s name is Robert’, and he said he heard a horse coming down the path at a gallop, when he saw a cloaked rider, which may have been Gallagher riding towards the NorthWest with a sack. I am getting ready to go, just picking up my bow and a cloak for the ride”. Helen realized she was in another decision point. Pretend that Papa had let her go and ride along with the squire? or ask Papa’s permission to go but maybe not be allowed? What to do, what to do?

Cold weather clothing is brought down too. Papa, the Lord of Mistral, looked from the patio as Helen and Adam departed through the gate to the west road at a trot.

Could you repair it?” Randy answered from the logging team, sure thing, we keep spares on site for common repairs and fortunately the bearings are only two sizes, which we keep, I’m pretty sure your Papa will be good to cover the replacement part, but to lower the price we could use some help.

Forage for Sparky would be a problem, but the cart was a little lighter with the provisions dropping. Starting the fires were difficult with cold weather but the dry sticks burned merrily when they started. The fires were short lasting though and the last of the coals were burned out in an hour and a half, then the chill multiplied. Fortunately, the hot water warmed everyone some more before falling asleep in the buggy. In the morning the wind finally died down after buffeting the buggy all night and moaning through the rocks of the Cairn. Even Sparky, who slept well in any conditions was frazzled in the morning and even more surly now that all the oats were gone, with no breakfast. Adam said “that patch of grey just may be what closes this pass for the rest of the year, we need to get a move on” Sparky’s eyes followed his pointing hand and she quickly moved to the traces for buggy as if understanding what Adam and Helen were thinking. Progress at first was fast despite the headwind, the gale from yesterday had blown most of the snow up and over the ridgeline to the East side where they had climbed through already, so there was no longer a need to snowshoe, in fact the only concern was making sure they didn’t go too fast downhill. The grey clouds steadily expanded across the sky during the descent. Helen looked forward then a look of concern crossed her face.

Adam looked at her with a shrug showing he didn’t know which way was correct. The grey clouds now completely clotted out the blue skies of before and large snow flakes started falling.

We will make two trips over the pass for the year, one in Spring and one in Fall. All you need to do is calculate the right amount of cheese, so we don’t waste it or run short”. Fortunately, Helen had been at the census which was a duty of Stephen, and he had used the time as another opportunity to tutor her and build an accurate town count. Helen thought “who would have thought that stuffy old teacher would be good for something in these travels?” Stephen had settled upon a number of 1024 permanent town residents and another 944 that regularly came for church and market, although he constantly complained about how the number was fluctuating with new births and people moving into town. He guessed his count was right for about 5 minutes, but it was the best they had without hiring a fulltime census taker and wasting labor in constant tabulation. Round the permanent town residents and regular visitors to the nearest hundred before solving. How much cheese does Helen order?

That way you’re mind and body are ready for hard work or problem solving, and you don’t go to fat in your sleep. The party arrived and drystacked stone walls supported each of the roads. Helen smiled and said “this must be the terrace farms the Schott’s told us about, they’re magnificent, like giant’s steps!”. As they approached the camp large fires were being made in front of each of the A frames, the people were wrapping large wet leaves around potatoes, vegetables, and corn then throwing them on the fire to cook. It was very rustic. .” Helen was becoming hungry and said “not to be abrupt, but could we have some of your vegetables and have you seen a man travelling on a single horse, carrying a rabbit?” The wiry fellow then said “do you always start a conversation that way?” Then he guffawed, and said “I haven’t even introduced myself properly yet.

Helen recalled that Joseph the court astrologer had been inspecting the retaining walls at the castle while construction was underway. He had come from the Hanging Gardens as a youth and had built the walls until he realized he enjoyed his studies far more than the fitting dry stone walls together like an eternal jigsaw puzzle. Joseph insisted that the retaining wall be ¼ the ratio of the height, in width of stone, if you wanted to be certain it would last indefinitely. Furthermore, the dry stone was preferable as it allowed drainage rather than creating a dam, blocking the water and overloading the stone.

Adam and Helen departed in the fog on the switchback road descending the steep part of the mountain. As conversation petered out they saw a waterfall in the distance and as they stared at it in a lazy stupor of steady walking, Helen and Adam were jarred back to the wakefulness by a sharp order “Get out of the buggy! We’re road agents and we have you covered!” Two stocky men with bows and hatchets stepped from behind the tree. To Adam and Helen’s eyes they looked like simple bandits. The two bows at their backs made for a tense ride but it ended shortly at a flat space on the mountain. A very small cabin of very rough hewn timbers and a stone chimney was the tollhouse. Adam laughed “ this isn’t a tollhouse, it’s a shack, and you are robbers” too this the dark haired one said, “not all of us are so spoiled we can travel by buggy, this was the best work we could get after our ship broke up on the sholes, no one would hire us after that, they said we were a pair of Jonahs.

The mood lightened when Sparky defecated to say goodbye in her own way to the road crew. Eventually the town of laFayette came into view, the town had grown past it’s walls and it was split by the river. laFayette was famous as the place where the boatmen travelled their barges carrying loads of grain down to Seaside, and dried fish or other imports up from the port city into the interior. The boatmen used giant oxen for the ride upstream and long poles as well as the current to navigate downstream with the heavy loads of grain.
